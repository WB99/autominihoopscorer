## Automatic Mini Basketball Scoring System
This project developed an automatic scoring system for a mini basketball hoop using IoT and embedded machine learning to provide real-time feedback on shot accuracy. The system employed an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense with an IMU sensor to collect data on shot attempts. Data from 200 shots (100 makes and 100 misses) were collected and used to train Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D) models. The Conv1D model, achieving a 97% accuracy after conversion to TensorFlow Lite, was selected for deployment. The Arduino program captures IMU data upon detecting motion, normalizes the data, and performs inference to classify shots as makes or misses, sending results to a mobile app via Bluetooth. 
The mobile app, developed using MIT App Inventor, displays real-time shot results and logs cumulative shot data, including shots made, missed, total attempts, and shooting accuracy percentage. The system is optimized for power efficiency, remaining in a low-power state until triggered by motion. This project demonstrates the potential of integrating IoT and machine learning for sports training, offering a promising tool for basketball players to receive immediate feedback and improve their shooting skills. Future improvements could focus on enhancing inference accuracy and expanding the systemâ€™s analytical capabilities to provide more detailed feedback.
